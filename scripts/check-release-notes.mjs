// Two guards on publishable packages, both run by the pre-commit hook and the CI lint job:
//
// 1. Every publishable package must have a release-notes file for its current version.
//    cd-packages.yml reads packages/<pkg>/release-notes/<version>.md at publish time and refuses
//    to release without it; this catches the same gap earlier, so a version bump can't land on
//    main without its notes.
// 2. A package with *staged changes* must sit ahead of its latest npm-published version - you
//    can't edit a package and forget the bump. Packages with no staged changes are skipped, so
//    resting at the published version is fine, and repeated commits against one unreleased
//    version (e.g. 1.1.0 while 1.0.0 is live) all pass without touching the version again.
//
// Private packages are skipped by both (they never publish). Guard 2 needs the network: when the
// registry is unreachable it warns and passes, so being offline never blocks a commit.
// Run `pnpm check:release-notes`.
